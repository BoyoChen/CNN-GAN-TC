## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
# install pipenv (if you don't have it installed yet)
pip install pipenv

# use pipenv
pipenv install

# install tensorflow **in the** pipenv shell, (choose compatible tensorflow version according to your cuda/cudnn version)
pipenv run pip install tesorflow
```

## Training

To run the experiments in the paper, run this command:

```train
pipenv run python main.py <experiment_path> train

# To limit GPU usage, add an argument:
pipenv run python main.py <experiment_path> train --GPU_limit 3000

<experiment_path>:
experiments/GAN_experiments/five_stage_training.yml: The proposed model.
experiments/GAN_experiments/three_stage_training.yml: The elementary version of the proposed model.

experiments/regressor_experiments/reproduce_CNN-TC.yml: The reproduction of the formar work.
experiments/regressor_experiments/channel_composition_Vmax.yml: To obtain the Fig.7 in the paper.
```

***Notice that on the very first execution, it will download and extract the dataset before saving it into a folder "TCIR_data/".
This demands approximately 80GB space on disk. :)***

## Evaluation

All the experiment is evaluated automaticly by tensorboard and recorded in the folder "logs".
To check the result:

```eval
pipenv run tensorboard --logdir logs

# If you're running this on somewhat like a work station, bind port by arguments:
pipenv run tensorboard --logdir logs --port=6090 --bind_all
```
